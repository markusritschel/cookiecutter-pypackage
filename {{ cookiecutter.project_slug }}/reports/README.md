# Important hint

For written reports resulting from your project, you may consider using MyST-MD rather than Jupyter-Book or Sphinx as this will not be a mere technical documentation of your project but rather a report or paper-alike document.

Follow the instructions on https://mystmd.org/ to create your website version of this report or export it to PDF or LaTeX.

You may delete this README ;-)

## Start with sample projects

### Jupyter-Book

From inside the `reports` directory, execute

```bash
mkdir jbook
cd jbook
jupyter book init
```

> [!note]
> You may need to install `jupyter-book` first.

More info [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/create.html).

### MyST-MD

From inside the `reports` directory, execute

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd-quickstart.git myst-article
cd myst-article
myst init
```

> [!note]
> You may need to install `mystmd` first.

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to choose a different path (it's recommended though to place it in `reports`).
