# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}!

{{ cookiecutter.project_description }}

```{tip}
- Give a short introduction on what the package is about.
- Limit yourself to just a few sentences.
- You may also give some instructions on how to navigate through the documentation.
```


## Getting Started

The table of contents (TOC) is embedded on this page, but it is hidden by default. You can access it through the side navigation bar and expand it to navigate through the different sections of the documentation.
You can also make it visible by removing the `:hidden:` option from the TOC directive in the source code of this page.

Except from the `api/index` page, which is automatically generated by the `autoapi` extension, all pages in this documentation are written in Markdown. You can find the source files for these pages in the `docs/` directory of this project.
In the TOC, these pages are listed without the `.md` file extension.
